During my middle school days, I thought it would be best or easy for me to perm my hair as opposed to dealing with it while it's in its natural state. I first completed the big chop in the year of 2011. It was a big step for me because my hair went from touching my back to being only about three inches long. Although it was a lot shorter than I was used to, I must admit that it was a lot easier to manage. Wash days were quicker because I didn't have to worry about straightening my hair afterwards. I would wash my hair about once a week and I would keep it soft and moisturized by using leave in conditioner a long with some type of oil, usually being vitamin E oil. I experimented a lot with different products to see which one works best for me. I've used Shea Moisture, Mixed Chicks, Carols Daughter and the list continued. I now use the brand QP and it works the best for me. I really encourage people with naturally kinky hair to give being natural a chance. A lot of people are quick to perm their hair to make it manageable but they fail to embrace their natural roots. All curls are beautiful rather they are tight curls or loose curls and I feel that no one should be ashamed of their roots";}
